# Question
Write a shell script that contains a function search_text. This function takes two arguments file_name and search_string and then writes all those lines from the file that contain the string to a file text_found. Now, take file name and search string as input from user and call the search_text function. In the end display the text from text_found file in the less application

# Working

Create a new file and type some text in it

While running the script enter the file name you have created

And then enters a string you want to search in that file


# Download

Move the file to the desired directory and then right click to open the terminal

# Make the shell script executable: 
We can do it using the chmod command. For example if the script file is saved with the name TEST then me can make
it executable in the following way:

sudo chmod 777 TEST

# To run the script, type:

./TEST
